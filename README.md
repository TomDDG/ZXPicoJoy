# ZXPicoJoy
Programmable Joystick Interface for the ZX Spectrum using a Raspberry Pico

## The PCB
PCB designed to have all the components on the side away from the Spectrum to give more room. The edge connector then sits on the back side as well as the OLED so this is visible to the user. This is also why the buttons are reversed.
