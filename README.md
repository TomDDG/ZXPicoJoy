# ZXPicoJoy
Programmable Joystick Interface for the ZX Spectrum using a Raspberry Pico

### The PCB
PCB designed to have all the components on the side away from the Spectrum to give more room. The edge connector then sits on the back side as well as the OLED so this is visible to the user. This is also why the buttons are reversed.

### Bill of Materials (BoM)
- 1x [Raspberry Pico](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico?variant=40059364311123). Recommend H variant as header pre-soldered.
- 2x [SN74LVC245AN Octal Bus Transceiver With 3-State Outputs](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/595-SN74LVC245AN). Note these need to be the LVC variant to work with the 3v3 of the Pico.
  - Optional 2x10pin sockets
- 1x [CDx4HC4075 Triple 3-Input OR Gates](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/595-CD74HC4075EE4). Note these need to be the HC variant in order to work with 3V3 supply voltage.
  - Optional 2x7pin socket
- 3x [100nF/0.1uF Capacitor](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Vishay-BC-Components/K104K15X7RF5TH5?qs=CuWZN%2F5Vbiofhf%252BuZNGw%2Fg%3D%3D) 
- 1x [1N4001 Diode](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Rectron/1N4001-B?qs=%252BtLcN0raKGUACwkD5chVvg%3D%3D) or [1N5158 Diode](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/1N5817?qs=JV7lzlMm3yKNnxZdh%252BSMnw%3D%3D)
- 1x [56pin PCB Edge Connector](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&_nkw=zx+spectrum+edge+connector&_sacat=0). Needs both ends cutting off, the pins removing top & bottom at position 5 and a piece of plastic or metal inserting for the slot (see [ZX Spectrum Edge Connector](https://i0.wp.com/projectspeccy.com/documents/ZXSpectrum_Edge_Connector_Diagram_48K.jpg)). This ensures everything aligns when connecting.
- 2x [20pin female header sockets](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=20pin+female+header+socket&_sacat=0)
- 5x [6x6x9mm Right Angled PCB Momentary Push Button](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=6x6x9mm+Right+Angled+PCB+Momentary+Push+Button&_sacat=0)
- 1x [6x6x9mm PCB Momentary Push Button](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=6x6x9mm+PCB+Momentary+Push+Button&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_osacat=0&_odkw=6+x+6+x9mm+right+angled+pcb+momentary+push+button)
- 1x [DE9 9pin Male PCB Connector](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=db9+9pin+pcb+male+connector&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_osacat=0&_odkw=db9+9pin+pcb+male+connector)
